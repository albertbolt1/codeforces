# quizapp
just about webapps
<b>Simple quizapp</b>
<ul>
<li>This was one of my first Django Projects</li>
<li>created a basic django quiz app where a user can enter his name and play the friends quiz</li>
<li>very basic minimal frontend because I concentrated more on backend</li>
<li>we can play the friends quiz and we will get some points which will be put back into a table</li>
<li>The project displays the table of top scorers along with name and the points squared</li>
</ul>
<b>What i learnt from the project </b>
<ul>
<li>creation of models in Django</li>
<li>creation of forms in Django</li>
<li>Django uses MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture</li>
<li>we create the models which save data and then we create views and urlmappings </li>
<li>the templates are created and we go to the templates which are rendered in the views</li>
<li>the views are used to create urls and we use the urls to move through the app</li>
</ul>
